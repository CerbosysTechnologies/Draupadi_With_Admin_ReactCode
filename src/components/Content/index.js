              She was born out of the fire. With lotus eyes, dense hair, and
              convex nails, she was as mystical as beautiful. An economist by
              choice, valiant empress, an outspoken, opinionated, and fearless
              warrior. She was anything but a 'tragic heroine'.

              Draupadi is more than a lifestyle brand. It's a tribute to the
              unspoken identity of the 'tragic heroine'. Just like how there's
              more to Draupadi, there's more to Sarees. Our bags and accessories
              are upcycled from sarees and handcrafted by women. We are inspired
              by the kindness and empowerment of Draupadi, and imbibe it to
              things we do.
